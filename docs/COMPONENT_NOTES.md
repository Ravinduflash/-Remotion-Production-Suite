# Community Component Notes

Working notes for every external component added to the catalog, plus pipeline gotchas found while adding them. Claude maintains this file. Add a section per component when it is registered.

Components live in `remotion/community/`, their catalog entries in `remotion/community/manifest.js`.

## How a component gets added

1. `write_component_file` saves the pasted source unchanged into `remotion/community/`.
2. `register_component { entry, persist: true }` writes the manifest entry: import path, npm packages, `sizeMode`, default props, inspector controls, preview kind.
3. Verify with `add_asset`, `check_scene`, `export_remotion` and `render_still`, then look at the PNG.

## Pipeline notes

- **Remotion version:** 4.0.526 is installed in `render-project/`. Remotion Elements built on `Interactive.withSchema` or `<Solid>` effects need 4.0.5xx or newer.
- **Version pinning:** `@remotion/*` packages must match the installed `remotion` version exactly. Since 2026-09-27 the render step pins missing `@remotion/*` installs to that version, e.g. `@remotion/effects@4.0.526`. `render-project/package.json` records them with a caret range, so keep versions aligned if you run `npm install` by hand.
- **Transform props:** Elements expose `Interactive.transformSchema` props such as `style.translate` and `style.scale`. They are not mapped, because the scene layer already positions, scales and rotates each asset.
- **Base props:** `Interactive.baseSchema` props such as `from`, `durationInFrames` and `trimBefore` are not mapped either. Timing comes from our keyframes. Voice Note is the exception, see below.
- **Keyframe interpolation:** colours and other strings switch at the next keyframe instead of fading. Numbers interpolate.
- **Previews are approximations:** the studio draws a stand-in from the schema. Only `render_still` or `render_scene` shows the real component.
- **Z-order fix, 2026-09-27:** `SceneRenderer` used to draw every external component in one HTML layer above all SVG layers. A full-frame external background therefore covered the whole scene in the render, while the studio preview looked right. Layers now render in scene-tree order, with consecutive SVG assets sharing one `<svg>`. 3D layers are still always on top.
- **Full-frame backgrounds:** register with `fullFrame: true` and `sizeMode: none`. Refit then resizes their box on aspect changes, and `check_scene` treats them as the background. Add them first so they are the back layer.
- **Preview guard, 2026-09-27:** the `paper` preview used to loop forever when `gridSize` was 0. It now draws a grid only when `gridSize` is at least 4, and defaults to no grid.
- **TypeScript target:** `render-project/tsconfig.json` targets ES2021, because Elements use `String.replaceAll`.

## Components

### Audio Oscilloscope

- **Catalog id:** `community_audio_oscilloscope`
- **File:** `AudioOscilloscope.tsx`, from Remotion Elements `audio/oscilloscope`, saved verbatim
- **Packages:** `@remotion/media`, `@remotion/media-utils`
- **Size:** fixed 900×300, so `sizeMode: none`
- **Controls:** audio source, waveform colour, line width, amplitude and time window. All are keyframable.
- **Preview:** `waveform`, an animated line
- **Verified:** 2026-09-27, [oscilloscope-f45.png](renders/oscilloscope-f45.png)
- **Notes:** plays its own audio track. Two oscilloscopes on the same file play the audio twice.

### Voice Note

- **Catalog id:** `community_voice_note`
- **File:** `AudioWaveformProgress.tsx`, from Remotion Elements `audio/waveform-progress`, saved verbatim
- **Packages:** `@remotion/media`, `@remotion/media-utils`
- **Size:** fixed 900×300
- **Controls:** audio source, played and unplayed colours, and amplitude are keyframable. Bar count, bar gap and clip length are fixed, matching the element's `keyframable: false`.
- **Preview:** `bars`. The played colour follows the playhead.
- **Verified:** 2026-09-27, [voice-note-f135.png](renders/voice-note-f135.png). Played colour reached about 50% at frame 135 of 271.
- **Notes:** progress runs 0 to 100% over `durationInFrames`, which defaults to 271, the length of the sample MP3. Set it to the new file's length in frames when swapping audio. It is also the element's own `<Sequence>` duration, so the component disappears after that many frames.

### Mirrored Spectrum

- **Catalog id:** `community_mirrored_spectrum`
- **File:** `MirroredAudioSpectrum.tsx`, from Remotion Elements `audio/mirrored-spectrum`, saved verbatim
- **Packages:** `@remotion/media`, `@remotion/media-utils`
- **Size:** fixed 900×300
- **Controls:** audio source, bar colour and sensitivity are keyframable. Number of bars is fixed, in steps of 2 so there is always a centre bar.
- **Preview:** `spectrum`, mirrored pulsing bars. The preview is taller and busier than the real render.
- **Verified:** 2026-09-27, [mirrored-spectrum-f60.png](renders/mirrored-spectrum-f60.png)
- **Notes:** a bar-colour keyframe switches colour instantly. A sensitivity keyframe animates smoothly.

### Notebook Paper

- **Catalog id:** `community_notebook_paper`
- **File:** `NotebookPaper.tsx`, from Remotion Elements `backgrounds/notebook-paper`, saved verbatim
- **Packages:** `@remotion/effects`, first install on 2026-09-27, pinned to 4.0.526
- **Size:** full frame via `useVideoConfig()`. The manifest sets `fullFrame: true`, so aspect-ratio refit resizes its box. Verified at 16:9 and 9:16.
- **Controls:** none. The component takes no props, and its paper and grid settings are hard-coded.
- **Preview:** `paper`, white with a 54 px grid
- **Verified:** 2026-09-27, [notebook-paper-f25.png](renders/notebook-paper-f25.png), 9:16 with a stickman and a title on top
- **Notes:**
  - Add it first so it is the back layer.
  - Use dark strokes on characters and text, since the default stickman is white.
  - `check_scene` counts it as a background and leaves it out of overlap and off-screen checks.
  - To make grid size or colours editable, the source would need props. It is saved verbatim, so that would be a deliberate edit.

### Paper Texture

- **Catalog id:** `community_paper_texture`
- **File:** `PaperTexture.tsx`, from Remotion Elements `backgrounds/paper-texture`, saved verbatim
- **Packages:** `@remotion/effects`, already installed at 4.0.526
- **Size:** full frame via `useVideoConfig()`, `fullFrame: true`
- **Controls:** none. The component takes no props.
- **Preview:** `paper` with no grid, a plain off-white box. The real grain and creases only show in the render.
- **Verified:** 2026-09-27, [paper-texture-f0.png](renders/paper-texture-f0.png) and [paper-texture-f60.png](renders/paper-texture-f60.png). The two frames differ, which confirms the texture animates.
- **Notes:**
  - It re-seeds the grain in 30 steps over the first 120 frames of the layer, then holds the last pattern. Past frame 120 it is static.
  - It renders light grey rather than pure white, because of the paper shading.
  - Use dark text and strokes on top.

### Rotating Starburst

- **Catalog id:** `community_rotating_starburst`
- **File:** `RotatingStarburst.tsx`, from Remotion Elements `backgrounds/rotating-starburst`, saved verbatim
- **Packages:** `@remotion/effects`
- **Size:** full frame via `useVideoConfig()`, `fullFrame: true`
- **Controls:** none. The 28 rays, the two blues and the speed are hard-coded.
- **Preview:** `starburst`, 28 rotating wedges that follow the playhead at the same speed as the component
- **Verified:** 2026-09-27, [rotating-starburst-f118.png](renders/rotating-starburst-f118.png), 9:16 with a stickman roundhouse kick and a title on top
- **Notes:**
  - It rotates 360° every 2000 frames, about 66 seconds at 30 fps, so the motion is very slow. At frame 120 it has turned about 22°.
  - The rotation keeps going past frame 2000, because this `interpolate` is not clamped.
  - The rays centre on the frame, so they stay centred after an aspect change.
  - Use dark strokes on characters, since the background is light.

### Typewriter Text

- **Catalog id:** `community_typewriter`
- **File:** `TypewriterText.tsx`, a sample written for this project, not from Remotion Elements
- **Packages:** none
- **Size:** `sizeMode: style`, width and height passed as `style`
- **Notes:** the pattern to copy for hand-written components that take plain props.
